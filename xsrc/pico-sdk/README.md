# Summary

This repo is simply a Outcast2 wrapper to the Raspberry PI PICO C/C++
SDK (sans example codes, tests, cmake support, etc).  The canonical source 
for the SDK can be found at:

# Raspberry Pi Pico SDK

The Raspberry Pi Pico SDK (henceforth the SDK) provides the headers, libraries and build system
necessary to write programs for the RP2040-based devices such as the Raspberry Pi Pico
in C, C++ or assembly language.

The SDK is designed to provide an API and programming environment that is familiar both to non-embedded C developers and embedded C developers alike.
A single program runs on the device at a time and starts with a conventional `main()` method. Standard C/C++ libraries are supported along with
C level libraries/APIs for accessing all of the RP2040's hardware include PIO (Programmable IO).

Additionally the SDK provides higher level libraries for dealing with timers, synchronization, USB (TinyUSB) and multi-core programming
along with various utilities.

The SDK can be used to build anything from simple applications, to fully fledged runtime environments such as MicroPython, to low level software
such as RP2040's on-chip bootrom itself.

Additional libraries/APIs that are not yet ready for inclusion in the SDK can be found in [pico-extras](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-extras).

# Documentation

See [Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://rptl.io/pico-get-started) for information on how to setup your
hardware, IDE/environment and for how to build and debug software for the Raspberry Pi Pico
and other RP2040-based devices.

See [Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK](https://rptl.io/pico-c-sdk) to learn more about programming using the
SDK, to explore more advanced features, and for complete PDF-based API documentation.
