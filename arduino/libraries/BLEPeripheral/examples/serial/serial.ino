/*
 * Serial Port over BLE
 * Create UART service compatible with Nordic's *nRF Toolbox* and Adafruit's *Bluefruit LE* iOS/Android apps.
 *
 * BLESerial class implements same protocols as Arduino's built-in Serial class and can be used as it's wireless
 * replacement. Data transfers are routed through a BLE service with TX and RX characteristics. To make the
 * service discoverable all UUIDs are NUS (Nordic UART Service) compatible.
 *
 * Please note that TX and RX characteristics use Notify and WriteWithoutResponse, so there's no guarantee
 * that the data will make it to the other end. However, under normal circumstances and reasonable signal
 * strengths everything works well.
