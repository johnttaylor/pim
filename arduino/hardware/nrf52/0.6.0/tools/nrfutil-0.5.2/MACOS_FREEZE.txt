Instructions for how to produce a frozen nrfutil executable on MacOS

These instructions describe how to use the cx_freeze tool to generate a
standalone self-contained (or 'frozen') version of the nrfutil script.  This is
useful for distribution so users don't need to manually install it and deal
with potential python version headaches and more.

Initial setup (do this once):
- Get cx_freeze installed for _Python 2.7_.  Very important to use Python 2 as
  the nrfutil script doesn't work with Python 3 and cx_freeze will use whichever
  version of Python it's run with to build the exe (i.e. you need to run
  cx_freeze with Python 2.7).  Assuming you have homebrew installed:
  
  - Update python 2 in homebrew to the latest version, and reinstall just to
    fix odd issues like links to old dynamic libraries that might be missing,
    etc.  Run:
      
      brew update
      brew reinstall python

    Or if you never had homebrew python2 installed run:
      
      brew install python

    Now just to make sure homebrew python is setup and linked as the 'active'
    python run:
  
      brew unlink python && brew link python
  
  - At this point when you run python or pip you should be using homebrew
    python.  Do not continue until this is true.

  - Make sure there is no other version of cx_freeze already installed.  Run
    these to wipe it out if so (it's ok if these fail with errors that cx_freeze
    isn't installed):
    
      pip uninstall cx_freeze
      pip2 uninstall cx_freeze
      pip3 uninstall cx_freeze
    
  - Install cx_freeze for homebrew python 2:

      pip2 install cx_freeze

    Make sure this completes successfully.  You should be able to run the
    cxfreeze script and verify it shows usage info:

      cxfreeze

- Install nrfutil dependencies.  Be sure to install them into homebrew's python
  2 as this is what cx_freeze will run from and use to find dependencies. Run
  from this directory:

    pip2 install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py install

- That's it, you should be setup with cx_freeze on homebrew python 2 and all
  the nrfutil dependencies ready to go.

Generating a frozen nrfutil:
- You'll run a cxfreeze command to generate the executable and place it in
  the binaries/macos location under the name nrfutil.  From this directory run:

    cxfreeze ./nordicsemi/__main__.py --target-dir binaries/macos --target-name nrfutil

  If it completes without an error message then everything should be good.  Try
  running ./binaries/macos/nrfutil to make sure you can get usage info.  The
  boards.txt should already be pointing to this file so try using it in Arduino
  to upload to a board.
