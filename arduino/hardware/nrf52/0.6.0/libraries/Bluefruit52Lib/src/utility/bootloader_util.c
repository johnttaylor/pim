/**
 * @brief Function for aborting current application/bootloader jump to to other app/bootloader.
 *
 * @details This functions will use the address provide to swap the stack pointer and then load 
 *          the address of the reset handler to be executed. It will check current system mode 
 *          (thread/handler) and if in thread mode it will reset into other application.
 *          If in handler mode \ref isr_abort will be executed to ensure correct exit of handler 
 *          mode and jump into reset handler of other application.
 *
 * @param[in]  start_addr  Start address of other application. This address must point to the 
               initial stack pointer of the application.
 *
 * @note This function will never return but issue a reset into provided application.
