/** @namespace Driver::Wifi::Station::Picow

The 'Picow' namespace implements the Wifi-Statation interface(s) on the
Raspberry Pi PicoW board

The implementation IS thread safe if the application is built with 
-DPICO_CYW43_ARCH_THREADSAFE_BACKGROUND=1; 

If the application was built with -DICO_CYW43_ARCH_POLL=1 then all calls to 
interface MUST be performed on the same core0/thread that the cyw43_arch_init()
method executed on.
