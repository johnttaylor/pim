/** @namespace Driver::Crypto

The 'Crypto' namespace provides a collection of Cryptographic functions and
algorithms.  The top of the namespace provides abstractions for the core
crypto functions.  This allows the application to decouple from any specific
platform (e.g. MCU with crypto hardware support vs Simulator running on 
Windoze or Linux)
