/** @namespace Bsp::UserSpace

This 'Bsp::User' namespace contains a 'Null' BSP for applications that run on
a desktop OS in user space.  The intent of this 'Null' BSP is to support being
able to compile code - for desktop OS targets - that have dependencies on a BSP. 
The 'Null' BSP is strictly for verifying compiler independence and very limited
unit-testing in desktop target environment.
