        NOTES:
            o There is difference between an "active" thread and a
              Thread object instance.  The underlying platform/OS
              determines if the a thread is "active", i.e. the thread
              is created and running.  The Thread object gets created
              BEFORE the thread is active and exists AFTER thread
              terminates/end.  Why the explanation, this method only
              includes "active" threads.  Threads that have terminated,
              but that their associated Thread object instance has not
              been delete/destroyed will NOT show up in the active list.
            o This call is mutex protected.  It will prevent new
              threads from being created/deleted until it has
              completed.

                              Priorities are defined in relative 'levels' to the max/normal/min
                              settings because there is no standardized priority settings
                              across Operating Systems.  If the priority value exceeds the
                              upper/lower bounds the platform's priority range, the thread's
                              priority will be clamped to the upper/lower bound of the priority
                              range.

                              of zero will size the thread's stack per the platform's default
                              stack size setting.
        @param stackPtr       Pointer to the stack memory to be used for the thread's stack. If
                              zero is passed, then the underlying platform/OS will allocate the
                              stack memory.

                              use/support simulated time when 'Simulate ticks' are enabled.
                              A value false will force the thread to always be a 'real time'

              a thread.  Once again -->it is a HIGHLY DISCOURAGED to design

              NOT delete/destroy the associated Runnable instance.
