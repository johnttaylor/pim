/** @namespace Cpl::Json

The 'Json' namespace is a collection of classes, modules, etc. for parsing
and creating JSON payload/strings.

Note: The 'Arduino.h' file/class/module is actually a 3rd-party file for
      serializing and de-serializing JSON strings.  The module is/was
      targeted for the Arduino platform but works on any platform.  The
      advantage of its Arduino roots is that is has a no malloc option. Because
      it is 3rd-party package - it does not follow the Colony naming/coding
      standards.
