/** @namespace Cpl::MApp

The 'MApp' namespace is provides a 'micro application' framework for asynchronously
running micro applications.  A micro application can be anything.  The original use 
case for the MApp framework was to support being able to selective run (stop, 
pause, resume) from the TShell console a set of tests use for board checkout, 
end-of-line manufacturing testing, emissions testing, design validation, etc.

A rough analog for a micro-application would be launching a console command to 
execute in the background.
