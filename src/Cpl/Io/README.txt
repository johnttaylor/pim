/** @namespace Cpl::Io

The Io namespace provides the base/common interfaces for reading and writing
data from/to streams and files. Essentially the Cpl::Io* namespaces provide 
platform independent interfaces for operations that would typically be done 
using Posix file descriptors or Windows file HANDLEs.
