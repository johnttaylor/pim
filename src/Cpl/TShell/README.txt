/** @namespace Cpl::TShell

The 'Cpl::TShell' namespace provides a Text based shell that can be used
interact with an Application.  What functionality the TShell provides is
application specific.  One example is a Debug Shell and/or Maintenance
Port that provides a developer white-box access to the running the 
Application.  

Note: The TShell is ONLY a framework/pattern for a Text based shell - the 
      application is responsible for connecting it to the application and 
      filling in the 'missing bits'.
