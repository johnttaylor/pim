/** @namespace Cpl::Text

The Text namespace provides yet-another String class and additional string
and/or text processing utilities.  What makes the Cpl::Text::String
classes different from other String classes is that it supports a ZERO
dynamic memory allocation interface and implementation.  There is also
a dynamic memory implementation of the String interface for when strict
memory management is not required.
