/** @namespace Cpl::Text::Frame

The Frame namespace provides interfaces for encoding and decoding text
frames.  A text frame is a sequence of text characters that are bounded by
a unique start-of-frame and end-of-frame characters. Text frames provide
the concept of a 'package' when dealing with stream based communications
and/or media.
