 /** This class blinks a LED at frequency specified by the 'delayTime' model 
     point provided in its constructor.  The frequency will be 2 x 'timing'.  
     The use of the model points provides a thread safe mechanism for other 
     modules to interact with Bob.

     The class uses the model point 'verbose' to enable/disable its text output.
     The text output uses the Trace statement to provide thread information and
     time stamps for the output messages.

     The class uses model point change notifications to set at runtime its 
     delay time and verbose state.  Specifically, the developer uses the 
     Console TShell command 'dm' to modify the model points and the Bob object 
     updates it configuration based on the model point change notifications 
     (i.e. event driven callbacks).

     The class uses 'periodic scheduling' for the LED timing.  The timing could
     have been with a Software Timer (i.e. a callback to the Bob class) - but 
     Periodic Scheduling is used to illustrate both Periodic Scheduling and
     events handling in a single thread.

     At run time - the application is required to call start() and stop() on 
     the module instance to start and stop the instance. The start() and stop()
     MUST be called AFTER scheduling has been enabled.  This is because the 
     class's model point change notification subscriptions MUST be done in the 
     thread context that the callback functions will occur in.
