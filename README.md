A sample of the book can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Machine-Software-Engineering-Development-dp-1484264398/dp/1484264398/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=&asin=B08TGPJX51&revisionId=&format=2&depth=2)

The book is available for purchase at most online book retailers or directly from the [publisher](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484264393)

I have a companion repository - [colony.pico](https://github.com/johnttaylor/colony.pico/blob/main/projects/Storm/Thermostat/Pico/README.md) - that contains a port of the book's Thermostat example application that runs on a Raspberry Pi PICO RP2040 Microcontroller.  In addition to running on a different hardware platform - the port contains a primitive GUI for the application.
